Home Is Where The Mobile Game Is: 96% Play Games In The House, 53% In Bed

Image (1) home-sweet-home.gif for post 211409

The magic of mobile games is that they can be played anywhere, but it turns out
that quite a lot of us are more than happy to play them when not on the move,
according to a new survey from mobile entertainment portal MocoSpace.

Taking in responses from some 15,000 U.S. consumers, the company found that 96
percent of them said that they play mobile games at home at least once a day,
and among those, 53 percent said they played them in bed — with more than 52
percent playing for over one hour per day and 32 percent playing for more than
three hours per day. → Read More

Windows Phone Marketplace Tops 70,000 Apps

windows-phone-7-marketplace

Windows Phone has been picking up steam lately, launching the platform in China
just yesterday and making headway as one of Nokia’s primary partners.

But when it comes to buying Windows Phone, the big hesitation for just about
everyone is apps. Both the Android Market and the App Store have surpassed half
a million apps each, but today Microsoft has an exciting (albeit smaller) bit
of good news to share.

The Windows Phone Marketplace has topped 70,000 apps. → Read More

GREE May Have Missed OMGPOP, But It Has Another Way To Expand: A Deal With Ad
Giant Dentsu

logo

When Kim first broke the news that Zynga was in talks to buy Draw Something
developer OMGPOP, she noted that one other suitor was the Japanese social
gaming giant GREE, which had already made a name for itself in buying U.S.
gaming companies, picking up OpenFeint in April 2011 for $104 million.

Now that Zynga has, in fact, bought OMGPOP, where does that leave GREE? In a
partnership with a local player, the advertising giant Dentsu. Announced just
today, GREE says Dentsu will help promote its games, acquire content and
potentially make other investments.

It’s telling that the announcement came less than 24 hours after Zynga
confirmed its purchase of OMGPOP, a deal thought to be in the region of $210
million. It shows just how heated the competition is among social gaming
companies right now for content and mindshare among users and investors.

Lookout: Lost And Stolen Smartphones Will Cost Consumers Over $30B In 2012

Lookout

From personal experience, losing your phone (especially a smartphone) can be
both frustrating and expensive. Lookout, a company that offers security
services for a number of smartphone platforms, has conducted a phone loss
study, which revealed that lost phones, if unrecovered, could cost U.S.
consumers more than $30 billion this year. As part of the study, Lookout is
debuting Mobile Lost & Found, a site for people to discover the places where
phones are most often lost, the likelihood of losing a phone by region, and the
financial impact of lost phones.

Lookout’s missing device technology for Android and iOS helps locate your lost
or stolen phone on a map or sound a loud alarm to find it nearby. → Read More

Galaxy Note Won’t Taste Ice Cream Sandwich Until Q2, But New Apps Sweeten
The Deal

noteics

The still-popular Galaxy S II just recently got its first official taste of Ice
Cream Sandwich, but Galaxy Note owners hoping to experience the same before the
end of the quarter are bound to be disappointed by a new announcement from the
Korean electronics giant.

Despite a proclamation from the company stating that the update would be
available in Q1 2012, Samsung has officially pushed the release of the Note’s
ICS update until some time next quarter.

Western Union Gets Into Online Payments, Launches PayNearMe Competitor WU Pay

wupay

Money transfer service Western Union is launching a new online payments
platform, called WU Pay, that allows consumers to pay for goods online by using
your bank’s online bill pay service (similar to the way you pay a utility or
credit card bill), or at a Western Union location in the U.S.

Here’s how it works. Shoppers can choose to pay with WU Pay at an online
retailer’s checkout page, and the order is confirmed with a bill sent to their
e-mail address. Consumers pay the bill the same way they pay utilities, loans,
insurance, and other bills, either through their online bank account or at one
of over 44,000 Western Union money transfer locations in the U.S. → Read More

Online Work Platform oDesk Raises $15M From T. Rowe Price, Benchmark

odesk

Online work platform oDesk has raised $15 million in Series D funding from T.
Rowe Price Associates with participation from Benchmark Capital, Globespan
Capital Partners and Sigma Partners. This brings oDesk’s total funding to $45
million.

oDesk offers a “marketplace for talent” that makes it easy for companies to
hire workers online for work that can be done remotely. This work ranges from
writing to marketing to data analysis and more. oDesk contractors are currently
earning more than $300 million on an annual basis, and contractors worked a
record 2.1 million hours last October through the oDesk website. oDesk believes
the market will grow to $1 billion by this year. → Read More

Ni Hao Flipboard: Reading App Takes The Bilingual Approach In China To Attract
Local Consumers

Screen shot 2012-03-22 at 11.19.09

Another step for Flipboard today as it continues to prove that it is the mobile
reading app to beat: it has expanded its offerings for China, a fast-growing
mobile market that this year is set to overtake the U.S. as the worldwide
leader in smartphone sales.

Flipboard is taking a double-approach to target Chinese users: there is now a
native-language iPhone app (in addition to its existing Chinese iPad app). And
Flipboard is also taking steps to make its main, English app more friendly to
Chinese users by integrating two popular Chinese social networks into it.

The big question now is whether Palo Alto-based Flipboard, equipped with all
this local customization, will be able to succeed in a market where other U.S.
Internet players like Twitter, Facebook, and Google have not managed to make a
dent against very strong domestic rivals. → Read More

Angry Birds Space Lands At Last

Bird-lovers and pig-haters, today is your lucky day: Rovio has finally pushed
the button on the launch of its newest installation of its hugely successful
Angry Birds franchise: Angry Birds Space.

The game — which Mighty Eagle Peter Vesterbacka told us last week will be its
biggest launch yet — is marked by new characters, a new physics engine and a
whole new setting that will take the familiar concept of catapulting birds to
destroy pig houses to a whole new frontier. → Read More

The Megabreach Is Back: Hacktivists To Blame For 58 Percent Of Stolen Data In
2011, Says Verizon Study

anonymous

Move over organized cybercriminals, the new gangs in town don’t want our money,
but they want to make a point, and they’re going to do whatever it takes to
make sure we listen. The annual Data Breach Investigations Report (embedded
below this post) from Verizon and major security agencies has found that
hacktivism from the likes of Anonymous accounted for 58 percent of all data
stolen online in 2012 — a contrast with years past, when organized crime groups
were the main culprits.

And, as is the way with hacktivists, they work on large volumes of records
rather than multiple, targeted opportunities: “The megabreach is back,” said
Chris Porter, principal on the Risk team at Verizon.

In an investigation that also involved United States Secret Service, the Dutch
National High Tech Crime Unit, the Australian Federal Police, the Irish
Reporting & Information Security Service and the Police Central e-Crime Unit of
the London Metropolitan Police, Verizon found that 2011 was the second-highest
year for data loss that it has recorded, since it stated the annual
investigation in 2004. In all, it analysed 855 data breaches covering 174
million stolen records. → Read More

The JOBS Act: Support Growing Biotech Companies Developing
Breakthrough Medicines

will-waddill

Small biotechnology companies are leading innovation across the country. My
company, OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, is working at the cutting edge of oncology
research, focusing on a specific set of cells within tumors that drives the
growth of tumors. We have developed a portfolio of antibodies that target
biologic pathways critical for survival of tumor-initiating cells, with the
goal being to stop those cells from replicating.

Entrepreneurs across the biotech industry are conducting groundbreaking science
like ours, and are deeply invested in treating the severe illnesses that
families across the nation face. At the same time, biotech leaders must deal
with the day-to-day challenges of running a small business. → Read More

The Inside Story of The OMGPOP-Zynga Deal From The CEO, Investors & More!

We caught up with OMGPOP chief executive Dan Porter, Zynga’s chief mobile
officer David Ko and board member and Spark Capital partner Bijan Sabet to get
the inside story of how OMGPOP’s sale went down. It’s been a whirlwind six
weeks for OMGPOP, which transformed from an also-ran social gaming company into
the maker of the most successful casual mobile game in the market right
now. The company was picked up by Zynga today for what we heard was $210
million. → Read More

Windows 8 Is Retina-Ready

header

All the talk these days is of the new iPad and its magical screen. Apple isn’t
the only one who can do that, you know. In fact, most display makers are
looking forward to post-HD resolutions as one of the big selling points of the
next generation of displays. Other tablets are already approaching iPad levels
of pixel density and it would be foolish of the likes of Google and Microsoft
not to be planning for it.

Fortunately, Microsoft is well aware of the trend and has plans in place for
dealing with pixel-dense displays (or “Retina” to the vulgar). → Read More

UpTo: An iPhone App That Unlocks Your Calendar’s Social Potential (In The
Right Way)

UpTo_screen2

Back in December, Robin wrote about a Detroit app development startup called
Rock City Apps, which had just raised a seed round of funding for its stealth
iPhone app, UpTo. At the time, Rock City Co-founder and CEO Greg Schwartz (also
the former CEO/co-founder of Mobatech and a director of business development at
Warner Music) said that the “platform focused on the future tense that makes
sharing calendar events simple and social,” but wasn’t able to say more.

We’ve since caught up with Schwartz to learn more about UpTo, which recently
went live on the App Store, and it turns out there weren’t any smoke and
mirrors in that description. → Read More

Ad Tech Startup Integrate Raises $11M, With Backing From Comcast

integrate

Integrate, a startup that helps advertisers integrate (yes, I said it) their
different ad channels and products, has raised an $11 million Series B round of
funding.

Co-founder Jeremy Bloom says the current ad landscape is “incredibly
fragmented,” with “a ton of point solutions.” So Integrate offers one tool
where advertisers can track and manage all of their advertising campaigns. The
company claims that its data is real-time, meaning that advertisers can adjust
how they spend their money on-the-fly, based on how a campaign is doing.

Facebook’s Paul Adams To Marketers: If You Want Bigger Ads, You’re Doing
It Wrong

paul adams

Paul Adams has given talks before about how Facebook is transforming
traditional marketing — after all, he’s the social network’s global brand
experience manager. However, he took a more provocative approach today at
Federated Media’s Signal conference, where he told the marketers in attendance
that they don’t understand Facebook.

He admitted the feeling is mutual. Marketers complain that Facebook doesn’t
understand their needs, while Facebook complains that marketers don’t
understand what works. Luckily, Adams wasn’t just complaining. He had specific
thoughts on what marketers are getting wrong, and how they can do better. For
one thing, he said that marketers who think Facebook needs to expand its
offering to include things like larger units and pre-roll ads are
“misunderstanding how our platform works.” → Read More

WarnerMusic,DefJamRecordLabelsAmongSpotify’s12NewApps

The record labels are in bed with Spotify, and now they’ll be in its app tray
too. Tomorrow morning Spotify launches its second round of apps — 12 new ones
from labels like Warner Music Group, Def Jam, and indie favorite Matador.
There’s also more ways to discover and rate songs with apps like TweetVine that
charts popular songs from Twitter, and Filtr that generates playlists based on
your Facebook Event guests.

Since none of Spotify’s competitors have gotten an app platform out the door,
the discovery potential of the feature could differentiate the company and
strengthen its domination of the streaming business. → Read More

Days After Major Aol Layoffs, AIM Is Experiencing Suspicious Login Issues

aim

Aol proclaims AIM is OMG since 1997. But today its users are saying OMG for a
different reason entirely.

Just days after major Aol layoffs effectively gutted the AIM division, many
users are unable to log into the service because their passwords were
apparently reset. Worse yet, Aol support was reportedly somewhat clueless as
well, asking users to verify accounts using the email originally used to set up
AIM. Do you remember where you were 12 years ago? → Read More
